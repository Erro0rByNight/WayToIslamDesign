        The Noble Qur’an is the heavenly book that God Almighty revealed to Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him – and chose him from among the Islamic messengers and prophets to be the bearer of this message and to convey the guidance of the Noble Qur’an to the Muslim nation, until this Noble Qur’an became. Thanks to him and the adherence to the commands it contains, the Islamic nation has become the best and best of it, for the Holy Qur’an is the Islamic approach and guide for every male and female believer.
 God has revealed to the previous heavenly books, which are: the Injeel, the Torah, and the Psalms, but the Holy Qur’an by its revelation was a copying of all the previous heavenly books, and everyone who wants to worship God and draw close to him and win Paradise must take the Holy Qur’an as a guide, guide and filter, and in it God Almighty revealed what Humans need it throughout the ages in matters of their lives and the hereafter, and it contains guidance and a clear light for Islam, the Almighty said: {This is the Book, in which there is no doubt, a guidance for the righteous}.
The most important characteristic of the Qur’an and its first characteristic is that it is miraculous. If all of humanity gathered together with all its thinkers, creators, writers and orators, they would not be able to come up with a verse like the verses of the Noble Qur’an, its eloquence and miraculousness. It will stand unable to, and the guide that confirms this property is saying: And all the stories of the messengers and prophets who preceded the Noble Messenger - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - in order to be a guidance and an admonition for those who contemplate the Qur’an and want to make it the light by which they walk in the life of this world. The command of its Lord, and in return for it the Sharia and the facilitating rulings to strengthen relations between Muslims away from grudges, hatred and animosity. It is important to note that reading the Noble Qur’an raises the status of the servant with God Almighty, and makes him rise in rank in this world and in the hereafter, due to the influence of the Qur’an on his heart, his thought and the way he deals with it, and the establishment of the principles of the Islamic religion in his heart and mind, and makes him think and reflect on the Qur’anic verses, and through it he reaches greatness The Creator, His Majesty, who sent down this detailed book with its verses, and this thoughtful recitation earns man from it a great reward with God Almighty, and it will be a light for him in his grave after death. As for the stylistic characteristics of the Holy Qur’an, they are many and varied. It is the miraculous in its pronunciation, clear in its phrases, in which it combines the general and private discourse, according to each verse and the reason for its revelation, and according to the place required for the revelation of the verses, as it is detailed mentioning all the details in some places, and brief For some matters in other places, such as the stories of the prophets, the reader of the Qur’an finds in some surahs mentioned in detail, and in others they are mentioned briefly. The Importance of the Noble Qur’an The Noble Qur’an is the book that God Almighty commanded us to read, reflect upon and worship God with, and this is sufficient for every Muslim man and woman to adhere to this Qur’an. It is very important for humans in general and for Muslims in particular. Nevertheless, it is possible to present what cannot be counted and enumerated about the importance of the Noble Qur’an and its role in the lives of individuals and societies. The Noble Qur’an will intercede for its companion on the Day of Resurrection. The Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: “If things become confused for you as parts of the dark night, then you must recite the Qur’an, for it is an intercessor, an intercessor, and a certified witness. The path of whoever says it is true, whoever acts according to it will be rewarded, and whoever judges according to it is just.” [3] The Holy Qur’an contains intercession for its reciter on the Day of Resurrection, and there is nothing that a person needs on that great day more than intercession. Whoever clings to the Noble Qur’an in this worldly life was a path to paradise, and whoever strays from it and leaves it strays away from Paradise, so how can a Muslim understand life and the rulings of religion, the lawful and the forbidden without having a guide, a method, and a law, and it can be said that the Qur’an is the ideal example that a person can adopt In his life, and thus his whole life will be Qur’an, his morals will be Qur’an, and his thinking will be Qur’an, and then he will reach high levels of worship, piety and God’s pleasure. Following the example of the Qur’an is good for the individual and comfort in his mind and heart, and this goodness will be reflected in the society. If the Qur’an is a method and guide for the youth of society, then the leaders and builders of society will be the best and role models, and they will ascend the Islamic society to the highest ranks and the most glorious peaks, and God will be proud of them with His angels and the Most High, and all of this It certainly reflects on the social, economic, scientific and Islamic life in society. What confirms the importance of the Qur’an is that it gives its reader and those who ponder its verses strength and steadfastness in speaking the truth. He does not fear the blame of the blamer, and does not accept error, defends Islam and Muslims, calls for adherence to religion, and strives for that with his money, soul and life, and this makes him a feared person. He is respected and has prestige among the people, in addition to that he is able to lead society with firmness, determination and determination to reach the good that pervades everyone. The Muslims throughout the ages and times, whenever something happened to them or their party, they found what they wanted in the Qur’an, and they found what they were asking about in its verses and surahs, and this confirms that the Holy Qur’an is the renewed book through the ages and times, and it is appropriate for every time and place, and no other book can be That he has these characteristics and importance, he is miraculous in his style and words and miraculous in his suitability to all conditions, circumstances, times and the development that humanity is going through. Our duty towards the Noble Qur’an This honorable book revealed to the best of the prophets and messengers and their seal, which contains light, intercession and goodness for all Muslims, must have a right on Muslims everywhere, and every Muslim must perform his duty towards this Qur’an, not do this It is the duty of some and not others. Whoever contemplates the Qur’an, reads it and reflects on its verses, he will feel the great responsibility of this responsibility towards the Holy Qur’an and towards the Messenger - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - who carried the message in his life, defended it and spread it among people. The first thing that every Muslim male and female must do is to believe and be certain of every letter in this Noble Qur’an, for it is the book that falsehood does not come to it from before it or from behind it. God Almighty in it, and applies it in his practical life, and then he will be confirming the Qur’an by word and deed, and it is important to adhere to respecting and glorifying the Holy Qur’an and not touching it without ablution and purity. When reciting the Qur’an, the Muslim must recite a clear, correct and correct recitation free from errors, because the recitation of the Qur’an is
It is weak and may change the meaning of the verses, and this is not acceptable with the Holy Qur’an, because the speech in it is the word of God Almighty, so it is necessary to recite the Holy Qur’an in a correct and accurate recitation far from any error, and there are many sources that a Muslim person can use to train to read the Qur’an Correct reading. It is important for a Muslim to learn the Qur’an by reciting it, its meanings, its interpretation and its recitation, and then he teaches what he has learned to those who come after him. He does not intend to teach the Qur’an in order for it to be said that he did such-and-such. For more reward, this Qur’an should be published throughout the world, not only among Muslims, and the ways of spreading the Qur’an and teaching it to the world are many, some of which are to be distributed among people free of charge, including what is by playing the voice of the Qur’an in places that are crowded with people, and sometimes its dissemination is through Through morals and dealing with humans, even if they are not Muslims, and thus it becomes clear to others the greatness of the Islamic religion and the importance of the Qur’an in the lives of Muslims, changing it and building values ​​and principles for them. Our Qur’an is our guide and our approach. It was sent light and guidance to mankind, and it was revealed on a blessed night, the Night of Decree. We all hope that the light of the Qur’an will be in the lives of Muslims and their countries so that blessing and goodness remain in Muslim countries, and their pride, strength and dignity remain.
