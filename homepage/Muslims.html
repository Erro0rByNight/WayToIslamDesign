        The title of the article is not from me, but it is a summary of a report published by the European police “Europol” and reported by “some” media outlets. , or the vast majority of them, as terrorists, so this report issued by the highest European security institution came to surprise most Westerners, and indeed many Muslims!

        Since the events of 9/11, attention has turned to Muslims as the source of terrorism in the world, and there has been no media outlet or specialized study center without discussing this issue, which has become one of the accepted issues for many of them. (loonwatch.com) chose this “satirical” title to express the state of terror portrayed by media images and some politicians in the West. The report stated that “Islamophobia” promoters are working to spread their claim that Muslims are “not terrorists.” (Almost) all terrorists are Muslims!
       
       Although this idea is becoming self-evident in some circles, it is simply not true, and the report was based on the records of the "FBI" (US Federal Bureau of Investigation), which showed that only 6% of terrorist attacks inside the United States from 1980 to 2005 was carried out by Islamist extremists, and the remaining 94% of the attacks were carried out by other groups; 42% were carried out by groups from Latin America, 24% were carried out by left-wing groups, 7% were carried out by extremist Jews, 5% were carried out by communists, and 16% were carried out by all other groups. In fact, a huge proportion of terrorist attacks in Europe (996%. ) carried out by non-Islamic groups. The percentage of attacks carried out by separatist groups that have no connection with Islam at all was 84.8%.
       
       The share of leftist groups in terrorist attacks was 16 times the rate of attacks by Islamic groups, while only 0.4% of terrorist attacks during the years 2006-2008 can be attributed to Islamic groups. As an example; In 2006, 498 terrorist operations took place, of which 424 were carried out by separatist groups, and 55 operations were carried out by leftist groups, while the "Islamic" charge was officially directed at only one operation!
       
       In 2007, 583 terrorist attacks took place in Europe, of which only four were officially designated as “Islamic”. Two of them took place in Britain, one in Denmark, and one in Germany, while there were 532 operations carried out by separatist groups, and 21 operations carried out by leftist groups. “Islamic” does not exceed 0.4% of the total operations described as terrorist in Europe!!
       
       What is the secret in this “hype” about “Islamic” terrorism, when everyone is ignoring hundreds of terrorist operations carried out by separatists, leftists and others? The report answers: “The perception is not the reality, and as a result of the influence and propaganda of the right-wing movement, there are people who mistakenly believe that (Islamic terrorism) is the greatest threat to the Western world. The same is in the balance, there is deliberate intimidation and focus when it comes to the actions of Muslims, which promotes the idea that all terrorists (almost) are Muslims.”
       
       It remains for us to ask: Is it fair and equitable for all Muslims to be accused of terrorism because a limited number of them practice that? Why is it that every time a car tire explodes somewhere in the world, people turn around looking for any Muslim in order to pin the accusation on him, so that every Muslim - especially if he is an Arab - becomes the subject of suspicion in the world’s airports and at the airports and even in the terminals of some of the airports. Is one of its passengers a Muslim?!
       
       The last 10 years, the theme of "Islamic terrorism" tops the titles of books, media, film films, centers' reports and political speeches, but has become the buttocks of all misguided practices from freedoms and lack of democracy and violation of human rights and the occupation of States. The war on terrorism, this “fake” war that did not eliminate terrorism, but rather increased its spread and ferociousness; Because Islam has not and will not be a cause of terrorism, but rather it is the most important solution to eliminating terrorism.
       
       No one can ignore this phenomenon, which goes back to its roots for many reasons that countries did not work on solving or addressing them. Rather, they empowered the media to “amplify” it. The news of the arrest of a suspect accused of terrorism in an Arab village was urgent news on television screens and on the Internet, and topped the news bulletins, while the news of the Israeli Knesset’s acknowledgment of the state’s Judaism regressed. To become the third news item in the news bulletin, or within the sub-headings.

       Hey newspapers and internet pages!!

The discovery of a terrorist group becomes more important than a medical discovery! And if this is imagined in the Western media, then what is the secret of “dragging” some Arab media into this path, unless you play a role in exaggerating this phenomenon to achieve other interests?! Exaggerating them does not serve societies, but rather makes them captives of fear and terror, and disrupts their development, and causes peoples to sacrifice their freedom and rights in order to confront terrorism. Is this what is required?!
